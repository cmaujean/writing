Dreams
======

Our remembrance of our dreams can be fuzzy and confused, as our remembrance of our meat lives is in the dream. This is due to the effect of transferring our consciousness across the divide between realities. Our actual dream life is much different than what we remember once we've crossed. If we practice, we have much more "conscious" control over our dream life, and more ability to transfer actual memories across the divide. Lucid dreaming should be a required class in every year of public school.
